# De Imitatione Christi

## Why this repo
As a reliable text of the Imitation of Christ in latin is hard to find on the web, I put one accented and formatted here.

## Content
- `de_imitatione_christi.tex`: main file, to produce the pdf.
- `de_imitatione_christi.txt`: plain text (without the LaTeX tags).
- `script.sh`: a Bash script to remove the LaTeX tags from the .tex file and produce the .txt file.

## Source
This text of the Imitation has been copied from [here](http://www.ultramontes.pl/de_imitatione.htm), with the kind permission of the editors of "Ultra montes", and accented with [Accenteur](https://brroman.github.io/accenteur/).
