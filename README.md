# De Imitatione Christi

## Why this repo
As a reliable text of the Imitation of Christ in latin is hard to find on the web, I put one accented here.

## Content
- `de_imitatione_christi.tex`: main file, to produce the pdf.
- `de_imitatione_christi.txt`: plain text (without the LaTeX tags).
- `script.sh`: a Bash script to remove the LaTeX tags from the .tex file and produce the .txt file.

## Source
The original text of the Imitation has been found [here](http://www.ultramontes.pl/de_imitatione.htm).
